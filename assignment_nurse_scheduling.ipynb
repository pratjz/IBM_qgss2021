    "\n",
    "In this section, we will implement a simple version of the Nurse Scheduling Problem, described in the referenced article and defined as follows (albeit a few minor modifications, applied to simplify the formulation of the problem):\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider $N$ nurses (mapped to the variable ```ǹum_nurses```), each one identified through a index $n$ (```nurse```). We want to assign the nurses to several working days from a total number of $D$ (```num_days```) to be covered, each one identified through a index $d$ (```day```). Our binary variables for this problem can be defined as $x_{n,d}$, referencing whether nurse $n$ will work on day $d$ or not. We will consider the following requirements to define our Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each nurse will be assigned a number of working days $F_n$ (```ẁorking_days[nurse]```) that may vary from nurse to nurse, out of the total number of days available $D$. Presumably, $F_n \\leq D$, leaving a number of days off as a consequence. This is described in the paper as the **soft nurse constraint**. We have removed the considerations about nurse preferences from the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each day, identified by the index $d$ (```day```) will have an associated workload $W_d$ (```workload[day]```) that may vary from day to day and will have to be assumed by one or several nurses. Each nurse will have an associated level of effort $E_n$ (```effort_level[nurse]```) that varies from nurse to nurse, so that the sum of the effort levels of the nurses assigned to any given date is at least equal to that day's workload. This is described in the paper as the **hard shift constraint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, we want to define relations between different days and/or nurses. To do that, we will use a coefficient $J_{n,d,n',d'}$ (```penalty[nurse_1][nurse_2][day_1][day_2]```), that can act as a bonus or penalty between nurse $n$ working on day $d$ and nurse $n'$ working on day $d'$. To illustrate this possibility, we will try to avoid having the same nurse working two days in a row, by assigning a high penalty if this term is considering the same nurse ($n = n'$) over consecutive days ($d' = d + 1$). This is described in the paper as the **hard nurse constraint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, there is not a clear objective function: we will have to set up the strength of each constraint correctly so that the solutions retrieved from the solver prioritize the constraints as desired. Presumably, the Lagrange multiplers of the hard constraints will be heavier than the ones associated to the soft constraint. We will now build our model considering each constraint independently.\n",

If you look at the Hamiltonian that defines this constraint, and the expression we just discussed, you will notice that we can consider $k = F_n$, and $x_i$ will be mapped to a variable $x_{n,d}$ **for a specific day**, as the expression found in Ocean's documentation does not offer a double sum, so $i = d$ but we will have to iterate through the different values of $n$ (the nurses) ourselves.\n",

As we will define this constraint in an empty BQM, we can ignore all previous values of the coefficientes or our problem, and the new BQM ```aux_bqm``` will be added to the problem's Hamiltonian by using ```bqm.update(...)```. When using the two methods referenced, each parameter referencing an index (```u``` and ```v```) will be a tuple ```(nurse, day)```, referencing the specific variable(s) $x_{n,d}$ being affected. The bias will be coefficient associated to each linear o quadratic term. Remember to multiply all coefficients by the Lagrange multiplier for this constraint!"
